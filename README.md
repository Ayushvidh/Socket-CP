<h2>To send data from Client to Server :</h2>


1. Open file directory in terminal and make sure you have a file called <code> client.txt </code> with the data to be sent to server.

2. run <code>gcc server.c -o server</code> and <code> ./server </code> to Start the Server

3. Similarly, start the client using the command <code>gcc client.c -o client</code> and <code> ./client </code> 

4. You will see that <code> server.txt </code> has now been generated with the data fetched from client side.
